# suckless tools

This is a script (intended for Debian Bookworm) that will install the latest tools from https://git.suckless.org

* dwm
* st
* slstatus
* dmenu

``` 
git clone https://github.com/drewgrif/suckless

```

Go to the cloned directory suckless directory.

```
./install.sh

```

Choose whether you want:

1. The aforementioned suckless tools without modification.
2. The nicely configured aforementioned suckless tools that I use everyday.

NOTE: The configured dwm has a list of keybinds at Super + h.

Further, if you want a customized dwm with these patches:

* dwm-alwayscenter
* dwm-attachbottom
* dwm-autostart
* dwm-fixborders
* dwm-focusonnetactive
* dwm-movestack
* dwm-pertag
* dwm-restartsig
* dwm-scratchpads
* dwm-status2d-systray
* dwm-vanitygaps
* dwm-windowfollow


My config looks like this
